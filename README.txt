# CSE141L - Final

It would appear that the hardware for the machine works perfectly well as there are no errors in the design. 
The assembler works perfectly and the machine code is able to be plugged into the ROM

It seems as though the transcript for Modelsim won't output any of its print lines to my transcript.
This makes it impossible for me to know if my actual assembly code is working perfectly.
Also, when using a filename in the instROM, I had to use the full path to the Machine code filename which caused some confusion and trouble.
Most of the challenges in creating this design is figuring out where to start. 
Looking at the entire block diagram made this project very overwhelming at first.
